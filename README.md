🚀 Document Search using Gemini AI, Text Embeddings & Streamlit 📚

This project allows users to upload .docx files, perform semantic search queries, and retrieve the most relevant document based on the query using AI-powered embeddings.

🔍 Key Features:
✅ AI-Powered Search:
- Utilizes Google Gemini AI to generate embeddings and perform similarity-based document retrieval.
- Supports advanced document search based on natural language queries.
✅ Streamlit-Powered UI:
- A clean and interactive interface with file uploads and query input.
✅ Automated Text Processing:
- Extracts and formats content from .docx documents while preserving structure.

🛠 Tech Stack Used:
- Python for backend processing
- Streamlit for building the user-friendly interface
- Google Generative AI (Gemini) for text embeddings
- Pandas & NumPy for data processing
- Python-docx for document handling

📂 How it Works:
1. Upload your .docx files.
2. Enter a query related to document content.
3. The AI searches and retrieves the most relevant document based on similarity scores.

This project is an exciting step toward leveraging Generative AI for intelligent document management in educational and business environments. 🚀
